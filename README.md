Christopher Magana Resume
=========================

A **one-page**, **two asymmetric column** resume in **XeTeX**..

 **OpenFonts** - uses free, open-source fonts that resemble the above - *Lato* (and its various variants) and *Raleway*.

It is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

## Motivation

I like the control that LaTeX gives over typical word resumes. As a computer Enginering student, starting projects is just second nature at this point. 

## Preview

### OpenFonts

## Dependencies

Compiles only with **XeTeX** and required **BibTex** for compiling publications and the .bib filetype.
